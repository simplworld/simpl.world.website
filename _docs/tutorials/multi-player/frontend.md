## Build the Multi-player Game Frontend

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux).

You will need to have these installed:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) >= 12.19
* [NPM](https://nodejs.org) >= 6.14
* Python == 3.6
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

Have the [Games API service]({% link _docs/getting-started.md %}) running in Docker on http://localhost:8100/ and
the [calc-model service]({% link _docs/tutorials/single-player/modelservice.md %}) running in Docker on http://localhost:8080.

### Installation

In a separate terminal, create a new Python 3.6 virtual environment called `div-ui3.6`:

Here is an example of using `venv` to create a virtual environment on Mac OS and activating it:
```shell
$ /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3 -m venv ~/venv/div-ui3.6
$ source ~/venv/div-ui3.6/bin/activate
```

Install the `cookiecutter` Python package:

```shell
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

Use `cookiecutter` to create the boilerplate for your game frontend.

```shell
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/simplworld/simpl-ui-cookiecutter.git
```

For the `game_slug` value, enter `div` (the slug value you used in the [Multi-player Game Model Service]({% link _docs/tutorials/multi-player/modelservice.md %})). 
For all other values, you can use the default or choose your own.

For example:

```shell
project_name [Simulation UI]: Div UI	
repo_slug [div-ui]: 
project_slug [div_ui]: 
game_slug [div-ui]: div
modelservice_slug [div-model]:      
topic_root [world.simpl]: 
app_slug [frontend]: 
version [0.1.0]: 
```

After the project has been created, create a Docker image of calc-ui and run it:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

Once the project has come up, open it in the Chrome browser.

To aid development, you can install the following Chrome DevTools Extensions:

* [Redux DevTools Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
* [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

It is also recommended that you configure your editor to integrate with ESLint:

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/eslint.html)
* [SublimeText2](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint)

In Chrome, head to `http://localhost:8000/` and login as `s1@div.edu` with password `s1`.
Once you are logged in, you should see the 'Hello Player' message of the skeleton app.
Open Chrome's DevTools, and select the 'Redux' tab. You will see a list of actions, and the
current `state` of the store. Note that the state has a property named `simpl`. Expand the `simpl` property
to see all the scope properties associated with the current user.

These properties will be updated as the model service adds, removes or updates scopes.
You will connect your components to the properties and they will update accordingly.

Logout by going to `localhost:8000/logout/` in your browser. Then login as `leader@div.edu` with password `leader`.
Once you are logged in, you should see the 'Hello Leader' message of the skeleton app. If you look at the `simpl`
state properties, information about all the run's worlds has been loaded.

In a multi-player simulation, players are assigned to a world with other players.
The cookiecutter template assumes you are implementing a multi-player simulation in which players
see only their world's information. By default, leaders can see the worlds and users in their subscribed runs,
but not the scenarios of other users. To accomplish this, the template `js/modules/Root.js` sets the simpl decorator's 
`loadAllScenarios` argument false to block access to scenarios of other users.

### Implementation

To implement your UI, you will write [Container Components and Presentational Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

The presentational components will provide the necessary markup to render UI elements, while the container components will wrap them providing the necessary data.

First, you will build the [Multi-player Game Player UI]({% link _docs/tutorials/multi-player/frontend-player.md %}).

Finally, you will build the [Multi-player Game Leader UI]({% link _docs/tutorials/multi-player/frontend-leader.md %}).

This concludes our tutorial! We have barely scratched the surface. A completed example implementation is available at 
[https://github.com/simplworld/simpl-div-ui](https://github.com/simplworld/simpl-div-ui)
that uses the game slug `simpl-div`.

There's much more that you can do with Simpl. For more informations, check out the service-specific documentation.
