## Multi-player Game Tutorial

In a multi-player game, all players belonging to the same world can access the decisions and results of that world. 
The decisions and results of other worlds are hidden.
A run's leaders can access the decisions and results of all the run's worlds.

This tutorial will walk you through the creation of the multi-player `Div` game.
This game implements a model that takes a dividend and a divisor and calculates the result. 
Each world needs a player with the `Divisor` role and a player with the `Dividend` role to submit decisions in order to get a result.

The game defines two phases: `Play` and `Debrief`. During a run's `Play` phase, players can submit decisions. 
Once a leader moves a run to `Debrief` phase, players are prevented from submitting further decisions. 
During `Debrief` phase, a leader can review the final decisions and results of all worlds in the run.

The game also provides server-side input validation and reports validation errors in the UI. 

This project will demonstrate how the various pieces of Simpl interact to provide a platform upon which multi-player games can be created.

For an overview of how Simpl works, see [Simpl Overview]({% link _docs/overview.md %}).

Start this tutorial by running the Simpl Games API service using the instructions in [Single-player Game Demo]({% link _docs/demo.md %}).

First, we'll implement our [Multi-player Game Model Service]({% link _docs/tutorials/multi-player/modelservice.md %}), providing the mathematical model for `Div`.

Then, we'll build our [Multi-player Game Frontend]({% link _docs/tutorials/multi-player/frontend.md %}).
