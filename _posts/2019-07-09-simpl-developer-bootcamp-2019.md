    Announcing our first-ever FREE Simpl developer bootcamp!
---

Built by experts in game design and education, Simpl is free, open source, and is a “simple” yet sophisticated toolset designed to transform learning experiences with serious game play.  We’re passionate about sharing Simpl with the world.    

To that end, the [Alfred West Jr. Learning Lab](http://simulations.wharton.upenn.edu/) and [Wharton Interactive](https://interactive.wharton.upenn.edu/) is pleased to announce our first-ever Simpl Developer Bootcamp!  It will take place online (we will steam every session) and on the campus of The Wharton School in Philadelphia, PA on Friday, November 1, 2019.  This 1-day bootcamp is aimed at developers to show what Simpl can do, and get you on the path of building your own Simpl simulations.  During this bootcamp you’ll hear from the core authors of the platform as we start with the design principles that govern the data model to writing your first lines of code to bring that idea to life.  Below is a tentative agenda for our 1-day bootcamp:

* The Simpl Data Model
* Build a Simple Game with Simpl
* Hands-On Coding: Single and Multiplayer Games
* Resources and Take-Aways

When we first built Simpl we had two distinct audiences in mind.  One was the developers who will use the platform to bring Simpl games to life.  The other were the practitioners who are professors, instructional designers, or more broadly, anyone involved in teaching that believes that a game or simulation can improve the learning experience for their students.  Though this bootcamp is aimed at developers, both sets of users are critical to the success of your game or simulation in the classroom.  It is our hope that the developers attending this bootcamp will go back to their respective organizations and find passionate practitioners to partner with to bring a Simpl game into the classroom!

If you are interested in attending either online or in-person please fill out the form below.  More information will be coming soon on this exciting event!
