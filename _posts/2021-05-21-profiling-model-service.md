    Use model service profiling to performance tune your games.
---


Work on the Simpl simulation platform began in early 2016. The Wharton Learning Lab ran its first Simpl game for a class of 300 students in the fall of 2017. 
This launch was almost a disaster due to the poor performance of the game's model service. Afterwards, the `simpl-modelservice` package was rewritten 
to use asynchronous requests and to provide performance profiling. Using `simpl-modelservice` profiling, the development team performance tuned that 
first Simpl game against 300 simulated players. This led to the game running successfully for classes of 300+ students ever since.

## The simpl-modelservice Profiling Functionality 

The `ProfileCase` class is used in the game's model service to create profiling tasks:

```python
class ProfileCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    A class for grouping profile tasks.

    Inherits from ``unittest.TestCase`` so that we can reuse unittest's discovery.

    Unlike ``unittest.TestCase``, it does not support ``.setUp()`` or ``.tearDown()`` methods.

    A ProfileCase contains multiple ``profile_*`` tasks.
...
    """
```

The `profile` management command emulates a single user session that may send HTTP requests to the Simpl server and WAMP messages to the game's modelservice.
A test user email address is provided to the tasks defined by in game's model service's **profile_\*** ProfileCase subclass.

The `profile.sh` script asynchronously runs the `profile` command against a series of test user email addresses stored in a text file and
reports how many seconds it takes for all tasks to complete. 

## Using simpl-modelservice Profiling

To add a profiling task to your model service:

* Add a `profilers` module to the `game` module.
  
* Add a file named `profile_test.py` to the `profilers` module.

* Define a profiling task in `profile_test.py` whose name starts with 'profile_'.

A common profiling task pattern simulates a player logging into the game and submitting decisions. 
In this pattern, the task retrieves information about the test player from the Simpl server, 
emulates the `simpl-react` **simpl** decorator's initial WAMP requests, 
then submits decisions for the test player. 
Example profiling tasks with this pattern are in the Simpl `simpl-div-model` and `simpl-calc-model` repositories. 

In the multi-player **Simpl Div** game's `simpl-div-model` repository, the `profile_test.py` file contents look like:

```python
import asyncio

from django.conf import settings

The single-player **Simpl Calc** game's `simpl-calc-model` repository's profiling task is similar.

Before running a profiling task, you also need to:

* Add a **GAME_SLUG** setting that matches your game's slug (i.e. GAME_SLUG = ‘simpl-calc’).

* Create one or more test game runs ready to be played.

* Create a text file containing the email addresses of players in the test game runs.

The Simpl `simpl-div-model` and `simpl-calc-model` repositories master branches illustrate how this is done.
The README files in both repositories contain instructions for creating test game runs and running profiling locally.

## Performance tuning your deployed model service

Once you have profiling running locally, you are ready to get real world timings against your deployed game.

## Summary

Using `simpl-modelservice` profiling allows developers to gauge throughput of their game under load and identify bottle necks that need correction. 
Performance tuning your game before its first launch contributes to peace of mind.
