    Use model service profiling to performance tune your games.
---


Work on the Simpl simulation platform began in early 2016. The Wharton Learning Lab ran its first Simpl game for a class of 300 students in the fall of 2017. 
This launch was almost a disaster due to the poor performance of the game's model service. Afterwards, the `simpl-modelservice` package was rewritten 
to use asynchronous requests and to provide performance profiling. The game's development team performance tuned the game by running `simpl-modelservice` profiling 
against 300 simulated players. This resulted in the game running successfully for classes of 300+ students ever since.

This post describes how to similarly load test your model service.

## The simpl-modelservice Profiling Functionality 

The `ProfileCase` class is used in the game's model service to create profiling tasks simulating user actions:

```python
class ProfileCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    A class for grouping profile tasks.

    Inherits from ``unittest.TestCase`` so that we can reuse unittest's discovery.

    Unlike ``unittest.TestCase``, it does not support ``.setUp()`` or ``.tearDown()`` methods.

    A ProfileCase contains multiple ``profile_*`` tasks.
...
    """
```

The `profile` management command emulates a single user session that can send HTTP requests to the Simpl server and WAMP messages to the game's modelservice.
A test user email address is provided to the tasks defined by in the model service's ProfileCase subclass.

The `profile.sh` script asynchronously runs the `profile` command against a series of test user email addresses stored in a text file and
reports how many seconds it takes for all tasks to complete. It is useful for developing profiling tasks locally.

When logged into an AWS instance to run profiling tasks against a deployed Simpl game, the `aws_profile.sh` script is used rather than `profile.sh`.

## Using simpl-modelservice Profiling

To add a profiling task to your model service:

* Add a `profilers` module to the `game` module.
  
* Add a file named `profile_test.py` to the `profilers` module.

* Define a profiling task in `profile_test.py` whose name starts with **profile_**.

At the Wharton Learning Lab, model service load testing is done using a profiling task that simulates a player 
logging into the game and submitting decisions. 
The profiling task retrieves information about the test player from the Simpl server, 
emulates the `simpl-react` **simpl** decorator's initialization WAMP requests, 
then submits decisions for the test player using WAMP. 
Example profiling tasks following this pattern are in the Simpl `simpl-div-model` and `simpl-calc-model` repositories. 

In the multi-player **Simpl Div** game's `simpl-div-model` repository, the `profile_test.py` file contents look like:

```python
import asyncio

from django.conf import settings

    """

The single-player **Simpl Calc** game's `simpl-calc-model` repository's profiling task is similar. 
However, it uses the series of WAMP calls the `simpl-react` **simpl** decorator makes for single-player game players.

Before running a profiling task, you also need to:

* Define a **GAME_SLUG** setting that matches your game's slug (i.e. GAME_SLUG = ‘simpl-calc’).

* Create one or more test game runs ready to be played.

* Create a text file containing the email addresses of players in the test game runs.

The Simpl `simpl-div-model` and `simpl-calc-model` repositories master branches illustrate how this is done.
The README files in both repositories contain instructions for creating test game runs and running profiling locally.

## Performance tuning your deployed model service

Once you have profiling working locally, you are ready to run profiling against your deployed game. To get realistic profiling timings, 
you need to run profiling on a stand-alone server. The `simpl-modelservice`  provides the `aws_profiler.sh` command for running profiling on an AWS EC2 instance.

Once logged into your AWS instance, clone your game's model service repository, navigate to the repository directory, and install the requirements using pip. 

Before running profiling, you need to set several environment values.

Export the `PYTHONPATH` for your model service repository.

Also, export several settings from your deployed game's frontend and model service.

* Export the `MODEL_SERVICE_WS` value defined in your deployed game's frontend settings.

* Export the `SIMPL_GAMES_URL`, `SIMPL_GAMES_AUTH`, `ROOT_TOPIC`, and `GAME_PLUG` values defined in your deployed game's model service settings.
If these settings are defined in a model service settings file, you may export that `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` value rather than the individual settings.

Once you have created test runs in your deployed game, run profiling against your deployed game using the
`aws_profiler.sh` command rather than the `profiler.sh` command.

If your game's performance is initially disappointing, make changes to improve its performance and pull the changes 
into your AWS instance's model service repository before re-running profiling.

## Summary

Using `simpl-modelservice` profiling helps developers gauge performance of their game under load and identify bottle necks that need correction. 
Performance tuning your game before its first launch contributes to peace of mind.
